Overview of the project.

![api result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47799e8c-0da0-4b67-af82-30f489f253ea)

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API (OpenWeatherMap) with Python to fetch real-time weather data. It processes this data and visualizes it using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The visualizations are then compiled into a dashboard that provides an interactive and insightful look into weather trends and patterns.

Objectives

API Integration: Fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Processing: Clean and structure the API data for visualization.

Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create meaningful charts and graphs, such as temperature trends, humidity levels, and wind speed comparisons.

Dashboard Creation: Assemble these visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard to present the findings.


Deliverables

Python Script: A script that fetches, processes, and visualizes the data.

Visualization Dashboard: A dashboard featuring interactive and informative charts displaying weather-related insights.


Technologies Used

Python

OpenWeatherMap API

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)
